# Transit-Nexus
This project is a Spring Boot-based Ticket Management System for public transportation. It enables administrators to manage routes, stations, passengers, and fares, while passengers can use RFID cards to check balances, recharge, and view ticket history. The system integrates with a Postgres relational database and uses JSP for frontend.
